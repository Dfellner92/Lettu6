# Lettu6

After entering in your search query (the city name) you'll be returned the city's current forecast (Got the name, date, humidty, and the windspeed...only the UV index is missing) and city's 5 day temperature forecast (temperature only, couldn't get humidity to work). The city's name is then prepended to the search history. Also, the last city to be searched is stored in local storage in the "latest item" key value. I couldn't get this to translate into being the pages next loading screen though.
